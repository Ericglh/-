Wil:
	The Windows Internal Libraries (WIL) are a collection of libraries used across Windows source code to allow modern (STD-like) development when working with Windows-specific features. For example, the WIL resource wrappers include "unique_ptr-like" wrappers for internal types, like HANDLEs and events.

	All WIL classes and functions are, by default, available behind the wil namespace
